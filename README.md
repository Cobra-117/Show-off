# Git usage
To avoid any files conflicts, not fuck up the git and keep a good organisation:
- Work on your own branch and name the branch by the feature you're doing
- Commit regularly (one commit = one feature) and use clear commit names so we can go back easaily if something goes wrong
- A scene should not be modified by several people, otherwise it will create a conflict
- Only merge the branches when we're together some we can manage problems and conflicts if there are some
- Merge on the dev branch first, the master branch should only contains tested stuff that we are sure works without conflicts
